# Week 1 - Introduction
  - Resource and Environmental Economics is concerned with the efficient, optimal and sustainable use of natural resources (as inputs to production) and the environment (as a place to put leftovers from production such as pollution).
    - Efficient means no inefficiencies
    - Optimality requires allocative efficiency based on a social determinant of 'good'. This will vary depending on the values of a group.
    - Sustainability requires on going consideration of future impacts. This might mean sustaining a renewable resource so that it can be harvested in the future, or managing outputs so that they don't negatively impact on other resources or goods.
  - There are a lot of potential market failures in resource and environmental economics, and by the nature of the field there are often significant externalities. Resources and the environment are often not private goods (ie. they may be non-excludable and/or be non-rivalrous).
  - Resource and Environmental solutions
    - Create a market and assign property rights - someone will have an incentive to protect a resource if they stand to benefit from it's continued existence.
    - Create or change incentives so market participants act in a desired way. This may include taxes, subsidies, licensing fees, etc.
    - Government intervention, ownership, legislation etc. This may include restrictions on harvests, who can harvest a resource, total prohibition of harvests or emissions etc.
  - The functions of the natural environment within the economy are:
    - Creation of primary resources used in production.
    - A direct amenity for consumption (taking a walk in a forest, etc.)
    - A place to discharge waste from production (sound, pollution, waste products etc.)
    - A provider of life.
  - IPAT identity
    - A simple model for considering the impact on the environment of an economy.
    $$ I = P * A * T $$
      - I = impact
      - P = population size
      - A = Per capita affluence (a measure of consumption)
      - T = Technology (technological advancement could both increase or decrease environmental impact)
    - As affluence rises, population growth tends to slow.
    - As affluence rises, technological advancement will increase if 'environmental quality' is a normal good (ie. it has a positive utility).
       - Using the 'Environmental' Kuznets Curve we can understand the role of technology. At first, as an economy industrialises the benefits of production outweigh the costs to the environment, and impact will increase. As an economy grows richer (affluence increases) they value the environment more, and will seek ways to limit environmental impact.
       - This is comparable to the standard application of the Kuznets curve in development, where inequality will first rise in a developing economy but then will shrink as more people benefit from economic growth.


# Week 2 - Ethics, Discounting and Environmental Theory

  - Positive vs. Normative
    - Positive: How things are
    - Normative: How things should be
      - Requires a value judgement
      - These judgements are made using utility theory and a social welfare function.
  - Perspectives on the Environment
    - Naturalist Perspective
      - The environment has intrinsic value unto itself, outside of extractive value. The extractive value must exceed this intrinsic value for a project or policy with environmental impact to proceed.
    - Libertarian Perspective
      - Individual Rights are paramount
      - Outcomes are irrelevant; process is what matters
    - Utilitarian Perspective
      - Consequences and outcomes both matter - these are measured by 'utility'
      - The social welfare function is an aggregate of individual (human's) utility
      - Non-human utility could also be considered - depends on value judgements
  - Utility functions
    - A sum of individuals' utilities

    $$ \sum_{x=1}^{a} U_x $$

    - Utility needs to be comparable to be useful - without a consistent definition of utility, it is impossible to compare utilities of different individuals. (We use prices).
    - There are two types of utility measures
      - Ordinal Utility: Rankings only - actual values are irrelevant
      - Cardinal Utility: Actual values represent utility, and values can be added & subtracted to.
  - Pareto Improvements
    - An increase in overall utility that does not reduce any individuals' utility. A Pareto Improvement is a more efficient allocation of resources than the existing one.
  - Welfare Functions
    - A function that denotes the sums of welfares (utilities) of individual people.

    $$ W = w_1 U_1 + w_2 U_2 +  ...  + w_n U_n $$

    - where $w_i$ is the weighting of how much we value person $i$'s welfare.
  - Criticisms of Utilitarianism
    - There is no concern for distribution - inequality matters too!
    - A Rawlsian 'Veil of Ignorance' type question is not asked.
    - Individual preferences are not a good way to determine social welfare and allocations.
    - Simple maximisation of utility may go against ethical/moral societal standards.
  - Intertemporal comparisons
    - How do we compare welfare over time? Is an improvement today worth a reduction in long term welfare?
    - By discounting future utilities using a standard model we can approximate some kind of intertemporal relativity of utility.
    - However, is this ethically appropriate? This approach makes the far term future functionally worthless today, yet we know this to not be true.
      - Even 25+ year timelines are distorted - 1 generation!
    - Thus it is important to consider alternatives to discounting that attribute some value to the long term, especially when considering policies or projects that have environmental impacts which may last for years, decades, centuries or perhaps even longer.
