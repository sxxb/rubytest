# Topic 1 - Introduction
  - Resource and Environmental Economics is concerned with the efficient, optimal and sustainable use of natural resources (as inputs to production) and the environment (as a place to put leftovers from production such as pollution).
    - Efficient means no inefficiencies
    - Optimality requires allocative efficiency based on a social determinant of 'good'. This will vary depending on the values of a group.
    - Sustainability requires on going consideration of future impacts. This might mean sustaining a renewable resource so that it can be harvested in the future, or managing outputs so that they don't negatively impact on other resources or goods.
  - There are a lot of potential market failures in resource and environmental economics, and by the nature of the field there are often significant externalities. Resources and the environment are often not private goods (ie. they may be non-excludable and/or be non-rivalrous).
  - Resource and Environmental solutions
    - Create a market and assign property rights - someone will have an incentive to protect a resource if they stand to benefit from it's continued existence.
    - Create or change incentives so market participants act in a desired way. This may include taxes, subsidies, licensing fees, etc.
    - Government intervention, ownership, legislation etc. This may include restrictions on harvests, who can harvest a resource, total prohibition of harvests or emissions etc.
  - The functions of the natural environment within the economy are:
    - Creation of primary resources used in production.
    - A direct amenity for consumption (taking a walk in a forest, etc.)
    - A place to discharge waste from production (sound, pollution, waste products etc.)
    - A provider of life.
  - IPAT identity
    - A simple model for considering the impact on the environment of an economy.
    $$ I = P * A * T $$
      - I = impact
      - P = population size
      - A = Per capita affluence (a measure of consumption)
      - T = Technology (technological advancement could both increase or decrease environmental impact)
    - As affluence rises, population growth tends to slow.
    - As affluence rises, technological advancement will increase if 'environmental quality' is a normal good (ie. it has a positive utility).
       - Using the 'Environmental' Kuznets Curve we can understand the role of technology. At first, as an economy industrialises the benefits of production outweigh the costs to the environment, and impact will increase. As an economy grows richer (affluence increases) they value the environment more, and will seek ways to limit environmental impact.
       - This is comparable to the standard application of the Kuznets curve in development, where inequality will first rise in a developing economy but then will shrink as more people benefit from economic growth.


# Topic 2 - Ethics, Discounting and Environmental Theory

  - Positive vs. Normative
    - Positive: How things are
    - Normative: How things should be
      - Requires a value judgement
      - These judgements are made using utility theory and a social welfare function.
  - Perspectives on the Environment
    - Naturalist Perspective
      - The environment has intrinsic value unto itself, outside of extractive value. The extractive value must exceed this intrinsic value for a project or policy with environmental impact to proceed.
    - Libertarian Perspective
      - Individual Rights are paramount
      - Outcomes are irrelevant; process is what matters
    - Utilitarian Perspective
      - Consequences and outcomes both matter - these are measured by 'utility'
      - The social welfare function is an aggregate of individual (human's) utility
      - Non-human utility could also be considered - depends on value judgements
  - Utility functions
    - A sum of individuals' utilities

    $$ \sum_{x=1}^{a} U_x $$

    - Utility needs to be comparable to be useful - without a consistent definition of utility, it is impossible to compare utilities of different individuals. (We use prices).
    - There are two types of utility measures
      - Ordinal Utility: Rankings only - actual values are irrelevant
      - Cardinal Utility: Actual values represent utility, and values can be added & subtracted to.
  - Pareto Improvements
    - An increase in overall utility that does not reduce any individuals' utility. A Pareto Improvement is a more efficient allocation of resources than the existing one.
  - Welfare Functions
    - A function that denotes the sums of welfares (utilities) of individual people.

    $$ W = w_1 U_1 + w_2 U_2 +  ...  + w_n U_n $$

    - where $w_i$ is the weighting of how much we value person $i$'s welfare.
  - Criticisms of Utilitarianism
    - There is no concern for distribution - inequality matters too!
    - A Rawlsian 'Veil of Ignorance' type question is not asked.
    - Individual preferences are not a good way to determine social welfare and allocations.
    - Simple maximisation of utility may go against ethical/moral societal standards.
  - Intertemporal comparisons
    - How do we compare welfare over time? Is an improvement today worth a reduction in long term welfare?
    - By discounting future utilities using a standard model we can approximate some kind of intertemporal relativity of utility.
    - However, is this ethically appropriate? This approach makes the far term future functionally worthless today, yet we know this to not be true.
      - Even 25+ year timelines are distorted - 1 generation!
    - Thus it is important to consider alternatives to discounting that attribute some value to the long term, especially when considering policies or projects that have environmental impacts which may last for years, decades, centuries or perhaps even longer.
  - Efficiency
    - How do we define it?
      - Pareto Efficiency is one way:
        - Consumption Efficiency: $$MRS_{A,B}^i = MRS_{A,B}^j $$
        - Production Efficiency:  $$MRT_{L,K}^i = MRT_{L,K}^j $$
        - Product Mix Efficiency: $$MRT_{A,B}^i = MRS_{A,B}^j $$ for representative firm & consumer
      - Pareto efficiency does not have one single efficient point. There are often a number of P.E allocations.
      - For optimality (which allocations are not just efficienct but desirable too) we need a social welfare function.
    - In a perfect market economy to following conditions hold:
      - A consumer's MRS = output price ratio
      - A producer's MRTS = input price ratio
      - Market failures will distory these conditions however...
    - Partial Equilibrium
      - Found by considering one market at a time (rather than all markets which interact with each other)
      - In a partial eq. Marginal Benefit = Marginal Cost
      - If there are no market failures within the Partial Eq, the efficiency of a Partial Eq. will be the same as the efficiency of the general eq.
    - Summary
      - Efficiency holds when no market participant can improve their utility (without reducing another participant's utility)
      - Optimality holds when we have efficiency and the social welfare function is maximised.
      - Free markets are good at efficiency - for optimality we usually need policy intervention.
      - Partial equilibriums are easier to solve/work with but provide an incomplete picture when market failures occur.
  - Market failures
    - Markets can only be efficienct when everything is marketised and markets are perfectly competitive, property rights are assigned, no externalities occur, no public goods exist and transactors all have perfect information.
    - Alternatives to Markets include Public ownership, regulated markets, taxed/subsidised markets
    - Property Rights:
      - Convey power and rights to owners of land/capital
        - Appropriability of returns
        - Ability to divide or transfer
        - Degree of exclusiveness (can vary)
        - Duration of tenture/ownership
        - Enforceability of above
      - Property rights generally don't exist for flow resources (ie. resources like solar energy)
      - Property rights do exist for non-renewable resources
      - For renewable resources, property rights are complex - especially for movable resources like fisheries
  - Public Goods
    - A good that is non-rivalrous and non-excludeable
      - Non-rivalrous is generally considered to have some leeway - 'mostly NR' is acceptable
       |               |         Rivalrous         |  Non Rivalrous |
        |---------------|----------------------------|-----------|
        |  **Excludable**  |     Private Goods          |   Club Goods |
        |  **Non Excludable** | Common Property Resources  |  Public Goods |
    - The quantity supplied of a public good will depend on the willingness to pay for the jurisdiction that controls it.
      - The aggregate WTP is the sum of individual WTPs
    - Supply of public goods by cooperating jurisdictions (ie. a transborder fishery) requires honest cooperation in good faith - but large incentives to deviate make this difficult.
  - Externality
    - Externalities occur when there is a difference in the private and social marginal cost curves
    - There are both positive and negative externalities
    - Positive Externalities:
      - At the private eq. (Marginal Private Cost = Marginal Private Benefit) the WTP of the community is greater than the private WTP.
      - This means there is a net benefit, determined by the vertical difference between the marginal private and marginal social benefit curves.
        - MSB = MPB + Marginal External Benefit
    - Negative Externalities:
      - At the private eq. the WTP is lower than the private WTP.
      - This means there is a net cost, given by the reverse of the above.
    - Coase Theorem:
      - If I create a negative externality there will be a counterparty who is harmed, and if I create this externality illegally, I will be harmed.
      - Because each of our private benefits and costs are born separately (I bear a benefit and they bear a cost, or v.v.) the efficient outcome is best determined by the marginal social benefit and cost curves.
      - This requires 'costless' negotiation (ie. the agreement arises instantly without any loss) which is unrealistic.
      - Who pays to resolve the MSB=MSC requirement depends on who has rights to benefits/costs.

# Topic 3 - Pollution

  - Pollution Targets
    - What kind of target is desired?
      - Optimal, efficient or sustainable?
      - General or partial eq.?
      - Local, national or international scale?
      - Politically and/or technologically feasible?
      - Optimal growth or materials balance?
    - Which kinds of pollution will be targeted?
      - Which stage of production should we target?
      - How can we successfully target the right party?
    - Controlling Flow vs Stock pollution
      - Flow pollution causes damage according to the rate of emissions. If flow stops, pollution stops.
        - eg. Noise
      - Stock pollution causes damage according to concentration of emissions. If the flow stops, pollution remains due to accumulation.
        - eg. Chemical waste
      - Flow pollution can become stock pollution in some cases (ie. a high enough flow pollution may accumulate in some circumstances, but often dissipates quickly enough for this to not be the case.)
    - What should our targets be?
      - If zero, we eliminate a great deal of production, which is politically unfeasible
      - If greater than zero we must find the maximum net benefit of production wrt pollution.
    - Efficient levels of Flow Pollution
      - will occur where the vertical distance between the benefit and cost curves is greatest
      - ie. where the marginal benefit = marginal cost
      - The 'price' at which this occurs will be a 'shadow price' in the absence of a pollution market.
      - If the cost of changing production to produce less pollution is less than the cost of the damage caused by production, firms will simply choose to pollute. This is the abatement cost, and the marginal abatement cost will be the same as the marginal benefit.
      - If the 'cost' of pollution is too low, there will not be enough incentive to reduce pollution to efficient levels.
      - Where Marginal Abatement Cost is zero, firms will simply abate their emissions - no firm will pollute beyond that amount as it is costless to avoid emissions.
    - Controlling Stock Pollution
      - Stock pollution accumulates across time and space. Damages will be incurred differently depending on timeline and proximity to emissions.
      - If stock pollution is incurred uniformly the sums of each individuals' marginal damage and marginal abatement costs will give us aggregate functions which can be used to find the equillibrium price of pollution.
        - Responsibility for abatement will fall on those with the lowest marginal abatement costs
      - If stock pollution does not affect all participants uniformly a more complex damage assessment is required. In general the principles above apply but working out who incurs/pays what is more complex.
  - Pollution Instruments
    - How can we achieve the efficient pollution price?
      - We first need selection criteria:
        - Which instrument is cost efficient to implement?
        - What are the long run effects?
        - Which solution is dynamically efficient?
        - What are the ancillary benefits/costs?
        - How concerned are we for equity?
        - Are these solutions dependable and/or flexible?
        - What information is required to implement/enforce these solutions?
        - Is it feasible to administer this policy?
    - Option 1: Uniform Standards (aka Command & Control)
      - A simple upper limit on any firm's pollution output.
      - This could also be implemented as a reduction requirement (ie. each firm must abate 10 units, regardless of starting point)
      - Pros:
        - Simple to administer
        - Incentivises innovation in production
      - Cons
        - Inequitable, may not be cost effective (firms with low MAC won't abate as much as they might otherwise, firms with high MAC may fold)
      - Least Cost Theorem:
        - The cost efficient level of pollution is when the MAC is equal for all firms.
        - This will not usually result in equal abatement by all firms.
    - Option 2: Taxes & Subsidies (aka Market Incentives)
      - Offer incentives to reduce pollution by introducing a tax (positive or negative)
      - Cost falls on firms for a tax, but on governments for a subsidy (negative tax)
        - A combination of both can provide funding from revenue.
      - Suppose a single firm pollutes and creates marginal damages
        - The efficient tax is where MD = MAC
        - If MD > MAC, the firm will pay a tax for their damages
        - If MD < MAC, the firm will abate emissions
        - Thus to increase abatement levels, taxes should increase
      - Suppose there are two firms, with different MAC: $$MAC_1 = 2A_1, MAC_2 = 4A_2$$
        - To find the tax level that achieves our desired abatement we want $$MAC_1 = MAC_2$$ and for $$A_1 + A_2 = 100$$
        - To find our abatement levels, simply rearrange to solve for $$A_2$$ , then use the budget constraint to solve for $$A_1$$ or v.v.
        - The efficient tax level occurs when tax = MAC of the highest abater. In the above case it would be firm 1.
        - We can use our values for $$A_i$$ with our MAC equations to find the $$MAC_i$$ and thus the tax level.
      - This gives us an equitable cost burden on both firms, making the tax cost-effective, equitable easy to adjust. The tax also encourages innovation to emit less.
      - However, to enforce this policy, firm-level monitoring of emissions is required
      - The cost of monitoring can come from tax revenue.
      - In the case of a subsidy, firms receive money to abate.
    - Option 3: Quantity Restriction with Tradeable Permits
      - MAC will be considered in terms of emissions, not Abatement
      - Consider two firms:

      $$MAC_1 = 600 - 2E_1, MAC_2 = 1200 - 4E_2$$

        - Without any restrictions firms will emit until their MAC is zero:

        $$E_1 = \frac{600}{2} = 300, E_2 = \frac{1200}{4} = 300 $$

        - With a quantity restriction, firms are issued emission permits - say 150 each.
          - How permits are allocated is another question entirely.
        - The MAC of firms when E=150:

        $$MAC_1 = 600 - 2(150) = 300, MAC_2 = 1200 - 4(150) = 600$$

        - The total cost can be found by measuring the area under the MAC curve:

        $$TC_i = \frac{1}{2} * E_i * MAC_i $$

        - As permits are tradeable and MAC are not equal, the two firms will trade permits to reach an efficient MAC.
        - This occurs when $$MAC_1 = MAC_2$$ and $$E_1 + E_2 = 300$$
          - the maximum allowable emissions: $$N_{firms} * E_{limit}$$
        - As in Option 2, simply find $$E_2$$ by substitution of the MAC equations then find $$E_1$$ or v.v.
        - We can then find our MAC. To check our answer we ensure that the above conditions hold.
      - This outcome is cost effective, equitable if permits are allocated equitably (which depends on our definition of equitable), and enourages innovation.
      - This solution does require a permit tracking system however.
      - Green firms benefit greatly from this system, as they can sell their permits.
      - An auction system requires firms to bid for each permit which produces the same outcome (as no firm will bid about their MAC) but costs more than distribution.
    - Spatial Differentiation
      - Firms produce emissions in different locations which effects damages.
      - Spatial differentiation can be managed by standards, special taxes or permit restrictions.
    - What if MAC is uncertain?
      - The government cannot accurately set tax levels.
      - If the absolute value of the slope of the MAC curve < the absolute value of the slope of the MD curve, standards are more efficient.
      - If the reverse is true, taxes are more efficient.
      - See notes for graphs illustrating the DWL of incorrect tax levels.

# Topic 4 - Climate Change

  - Is the climate changing?
    - Yes
    - Shifts in mean, min, max are all occurring and this is linked to carbon emissions.
    - Various measures of temperature change all suggest warming to different degrees.
  - Consequences:
    - High maximum temperatures will cause more deaths, droughts, stress on crops and livestock
    - High minimum temperatures will result in fewer 'cold weather diseases', shift in suitable land for crop cultivation, increase in warm weather diseases.
    - More extreme precipitation will occur, increasing flood risks, erosion, lowering water quality, creating water security issues, and increasing drought events.
    - More extreme weather events that damage infrastructure.
  - Is it anthropogenic?
    - Yes
    - CO2, NH4 & N2O are all major by-products of industrial society and all cause more heat to be trapped in the atmosphere.
    - Deforestation for pasture reduces the ability for the environment to 'draw down' carbon from the atmosphere.
    - Rapid change suggests natural climate change is unlikely.
    - Warming is occurring more over land vs water and is beyond changes that could possibly be caused by other sources such as volcanic activity, normal weather patterns, solar radiation etc.
    - Analysts compare various metrics and data types to construct robust models.
    - The trend is clear and will continue without mitigation.
  - Policy issues
    - The necessity to deal with varying types of emissions and the temporal separation between emissions and damage.
      - Some emissions are easier to reduce but don't cause damage equally.
      - Global warming potential measures the impact of emissions over a set time horizon.
      - This can help us mitigate warming by providing effective pathways and plans for effective (in terms of cost and abatement) policy options.
    - The uncertainty of the costs and benefits
      - We don't know for certain how much mitigation is required
      - Costs and benefits are not evenly distributed and we don't have a mechanism for balancing this across international borders
      - Those who are required to act are least incentivised to do so (as they have the greatest private benefit)
      - Discount rates also vary and on a long term project small differences in rates matter a lot.
    - Requires equitable solutions and international cooperation, with the added issue of vested interests opposing action
      - should developed countries who got to industrialise via dirty technology bear the brunt of mitigation?
      - Should future generations bear the cost of mitigation for a problem they inherited and were fundamentally unable to have any say in?
    - How do we translate this into actual policy?
      - change our energy fix (move away from non-renewable sources)
      - Improve our buildings and processes to require less energy
      - Improve transport solutions
    - A mix of solutions is not necessarily more effective than an extremely targeted high impact solution.

# Topic 5 - Residential Energy

  - Australian residential energy use and policy
    - Energy usage and prices have increase 50% over the past 20 years.
      - This demand is spurred by an increase in population, temperature changes, housing design and climate control expectations, the price of appliances falling encouraging the consumption of electricity over 'elbow grease', the age of household members and income growth.
      - Supply is effected by the fixed and variable costs of geeneration, the methods of generation and the type of consumer.
      - As demand growth exceeds supply growth, prices rise.
    - To address this, we need to increase energy efficiency.
      - This can be done via legislation (building codes etc.), taxes/subsidies, or replacement of old energy infrastructure with new, more efficient technologies.
    - There is a Rebound Effect: energy use does not go down as much as efficiency changes might suggest (as efficiency lowers costs and therefore more energy could be consumed - similar to income and substitution effects)

      $$ R = \frac{\Delta energy.use\%}{\Delta efficiency\% }$$

      - if $$R = 0$$ there is no rebound - a change in efficiency causes no change to energy use
      - if $$R > 0$$ there is a rebound - increases in efficiency cause increases in energy use
      - if $$R > 1$$ the policy creates a net increase in energy use - a backfire!
    - The rebound effect causes a lower increase in use than the efficiency gain
      - Generally for a 1% efficiency gain there is a 0.25% reduction in electricity use and a 0.4% reduction in gas and other resource use.
      - The rebound effect is lowest for apartments (who often have communal energy sources) and for renters in general
      - Higher incomes have a lower rebound, suggesting they are already close to their desired energy use level regardless of efficiencies.
      - The rebound effect suggests efficiency improvements are not the best solution to reduce energy use, but there are still benefits and if efficiency gains can be made we should make them.

# Topic 6 - Fisheries Theory

# Topic 7 - Fisheries Management

  - How are fisheries managed?
    - By manipulating output such that $$X_i = X_{optimal}$$
    - By examining the various formula we use to determine output we can understand which parameters or variables to influence to achieve a desired output change.
  - Taxes
    - A tax on output changes the price received for output: $$p \to (1-\tau)p $$
    - Thus output will shift:

    $$ X_{\inf} = \frac{c}{p} \to X_{\tau} = \frac{c}{(1-\tau)p} $$

    - Given we have equations for the social planner equilibrium (MEY), the open access equilibrium and the maximum sustainable yield equilibrium (MSY), we can solve the appropriate level of tax:
      - To reduce output to the maximum economic yield:

      $$X_{inf} \to X_{MEY}$$
      $$\frac{c}{(1-\tau)p} = \frac{ap+bc}{2bp}$$

      - we can rearrange this to find $$\tau$$
    - This assumes that the tax is applied and paid perfectly with no effect on output prices.
    - Taxes on fisheries are uncommon:
      - They are an economic, not a biological solution
      - This means bureaucrats who may be from a biological background prefer solutions with more direct impact on quantity control
    - A tax on inputs $$\gamma$$ falls on the cost side:

    $$ X_{\inf} = \frac{c}{p} \to X_{\tau} = \frac{c + \gamma}{p} $$

      - We can solve this exactly the same way as above.
    - Taxes on inputs are harder: they need to be put onto a non-substitutable good (difficult) and often have unintended consequences.

  - Quotas
    - Historically quotas are preferred as they reflect a more direct connection to the biological understanding of fisheries.
      - Generally they use the Maximum Sustainable Yield, not the MEY.
      - This means they don't require economic data to implement.
    - Quotas can be tricky to implement:
      - A total area quota incentivises inefficient behaviour (ie. a rush in which fishers try to quickly catch as large a share of the total quota as possible, leaving their equipment untouched for the rest of the season)
      - This results in lower quality yields, worse working conditions, price surges and falls and means fish are only fresh at the very start of the season.
    - Individual quotas avoid this: each agent (ie. usually on the firm level) has a quota that is a portion of the total quota.
      - This allows fishers to make decisions about when to fish - they will fish more when demand is higher, stabilising prices.
      - Quotas can also sometimes be traded/sold, allowing more decision-making options (skipping a season and not losing out etc.)
    - Changing to a quota system will usually upset stakeholders, especially if output is above the MSY.
    - Quotas also require tracking and enforcement
    - Input quotas are an alternative:
      - These may be vessel licenses, time limits, seasons restrictions etc.
      - Often these are too easy to avoid or 'game', or can simply be complied with, with no reduction in harvest.

  - Fisheries Management Practice
    - Goals
      - Ensure harvest is sustainable and returns are maximised.
      - This requires management of the resource.
      - Institutional structure matters!
    - Factors:
      - Access
        - Various options exist: open access, limited entry, quotas, ownership of a resource etc.
      - Decision making
        - Various delegation options: local, state, Federal or international governance is possible, or some combination thereof.
        - The appropriate governance structure will depend on the nature of the resource (migration, location relative to borders, historic relationship to resource etc.)
        - Decision makers must have a long run vested interest in the sustainability of the resource, and the power to enforce their decisions.
      - Spatial Scale
        - Regulation, data collection and harvesting must be considered and managed at the same scale - generally, the smaller scale the better for more focussed policy.
        - This accounts for the variance in geography etc.
        - Fisheries populations that are sedentary need to be managed differently to migratory species (as above).
      - Biological and Economic Factors:
        - Each species is unique and requires different conditions for sustainability. Species may even be interdependent.
        - Costs and benefits of harvests differ too, which must be accounted for.
    - Keys to success:
      - Appropriate incentives and punishments
      - Direct responsibility
      - Biological science-based harvest levels and management (economists should just assist!)
      - Self-regulation/co-management empowers stakeholders to take responsibility for their own resource, reducing the will to deviate (ideally!)
      - Simple institutions and allowances are better than complex ones if both work!

# Topic 8 - International Fisheries

  - International Fisheries are subject to UN Convention on Law of the Sea 1982
    - This enclosed the sea area 200 miles from the shore into national borders, defining fisheries rights into Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs)
    - This also created some shared areas:
      - Between EEZs (EEZ-EEZ)
      - Migrating Species (EEZ-EEZ-High Seas)
      - Straddling Species (EEZ-High Seas)
      - High Seas Species (Unenclosed)
    - Each type of area requires distinct analysis and management
    - There are varying levels of cooperation over international fisheries
      - Research cooperation is typically the first level of management
      - Active joint management (ie. setting the total allowable catch, implementing and enforcing regulation etc.)
      - Not all stocks require joint management - if the species straddles two EEZs but individual stocks are sedentary, the resource could be split along the border.

  - Game Theory
    - There is a prisoners dilemma between two countries sharing a transboundary fishery:
      - The NE is for both to cheat and catch more than their share, depleting the resource in the long run and lowering the overall payoff than if they abided by the agreement.
    - A solution to this must be pareto optimal and individually rational.
      - Let $$\bar{1}, \bar{2} $$ be the threat point (that is, the outcome for not cooperating)
      - The 'Core' is the part of the pareto frontier that has a high payoff than both parties' threat points. Any solution in the Core is sustainable
      - The exact position will depend on the bargaining power of 1,2.
      - The cooperative surplus is found:

      $$CS = (1^*-\bar{1}) + (2^* - \bar{2})$$

      - If there is no Core, external incentives may be required.
        - These can include direct transfers, tariff reductions or offers pertaining to other sectors etc.
      - The net benefits of harvests determine who is willing to trade what.
      - A Pareto Frontier with a 'side payment' will be tangent to the original Pareto frontier, but will extend above the threat point, allowing an efficient solution.
      - See notes for graphs.

  - Internationally Shared Fisheries
    - Global fish stocks are overharvested due to externalities - a tragedy of the commons
    - Shared fish stocks incentivise overfishing (in simple terms)
      - More countries sharing a fishery resource increases the probability of it being overfished.
      - Fishing in high seas is better than fishing in a shared EEZ fishery
    - Policy that ignores the risks of shared overfishing is insufficient to sustainably manage fisheries.

  - Reflection
    - Fisheries management applies to most other renewable resources to some extent
    - Any resource without clearly defined ownership or use rights is subject to the tragedy of the commons.
    - Without a global authority to enforce sustainable harvests, a shared resource will almost always be over-exploited.

  - Bans vs Fees
    - Disposable Carry Bags (DCBs) are convenient but wasteful. They do not break down and are easily spread over a large geographic area.
    - Significant externalities arise from DCBs
    - Paper bags are not a sufficient substitute: they are more resource intensive to produce and are less durable.
    - Fees incentivise those who can use reusable bags to do so, while allowing DCB use for those who cannot.
      - Fees raise the MC above the MB for most people

  - Leakage
    - Leakage occurs when regulation is incomplete.
    - DCB regulation does not cover all single use plastic and may not actually reduce overall plastic consumption
    - The rebound effect may occur if the policy target is not the good demanded
    - Non-additionality: when a policy attempts to encourage decision that would have been made regardless. Sometimes education is sufficient for policy change without the need for a heavier handed approach.
