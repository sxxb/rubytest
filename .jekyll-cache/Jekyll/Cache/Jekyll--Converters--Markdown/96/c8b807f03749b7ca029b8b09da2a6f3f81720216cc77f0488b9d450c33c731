<ul>
  <li>Definitions
    <ul>
      <li>Non-Cooperative Games
        <ul>
          <li>Games in which the players compete against each other to maximise their utility without directly communicating.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Strategy
        <ul>
          <li>: A <strong>complete</strong> contingency plan for a game.</li>
          <li>This means that every possible outcome must be accounted for.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Strategy Profile
        <ul>
          <li>The set of available strategies for all players that fully specifies all actions in a game.</li>
          <li>$S = { ABC, DEF }$
            <ul>
              <li>where $s_1 = {ABC}$ and $s_2 = {DEF}$</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Mixed Strategy
        <ul>
          <li>A strategy set that involves playing one strategy some of the time and another strategy (or strategies) the rest of the time.</li>
          <li><em>‚ÄúA probability distribution over a strategy space‚Äù</em></li>
          <li>Denoted by $\sigma_i$ for each player $i$.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Extensive Form
        <ul>
          <li>The tree form of a game that denotes the order in which moves are played. Offers more information about the game and allows calculation of subgame perfect Nash Equilibriums.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Normal Form:
        <ul>
          <li>The table form of a game, that denotes all the complete strategies of each player and the payoffs for each. Useful for calculating Best Responses as it is easy to compare payoffs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Expected Utility Graph
        <ul>
          <li>Give the probability of another player‚Äôs strategy being played (in a mixed strategy context), what is the expected payoff?
            <ul>
              <li>Y axis: Expected Utility</li>
              <li>X axis: probability $p$ or $q$</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Simultaneous Decision
        <ul>
          <li>Denoted by a dotted line between two nodes, which denotes that the player has not observed the previous player‚Äôs decision.
            <ul>
              <li>This can be because they move simultaneously, or because a player was unable to see the opponent‚Äôs move.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
