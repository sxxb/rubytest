I"Ï<p>Lightime Illumination are an Adelaide based lighting supplier focused on providing innovative, energy efficient lighting solutions at competitive prices. With residential, office and warehouse lighting options, they tasked me with designing product packaging using their existing logo and branding.</p>

<p>Working within their existing branding, I created a series of packages for LED bulbs, panels, spotlights, and more. My goal for this project was to create a simple design language for their products that would be easily recognisable in a retail setting amongst many similar products. Lightime also wanted to keep packaging costs down in order to pass those savings onto their customers which meant that a simple (and thus easy to print) design was preferable. Using their existing brand logo and colours I designed boxes for a range of different products that satisfied all of Lightimeâ€™s requirements and achieved their goal of being recognisable yet simple.</p>
