I"µ<p>Media institutions perform a vital function in modern democratic states by acting as an intermediary between current events and the general public.  This unique position grants the media a great deal of power over the political landscape. This power is not unlimited however; media institutions and individual actors are subject to material factors that limit the extent to which they can affect politics. In this essay I will examine the ways in which media influences politics, the ways in which this power is constrained, and demonstrate that the media holds significant power in the political sphere, limited only by the self interest of journalists, media institutions and owners.</p>
