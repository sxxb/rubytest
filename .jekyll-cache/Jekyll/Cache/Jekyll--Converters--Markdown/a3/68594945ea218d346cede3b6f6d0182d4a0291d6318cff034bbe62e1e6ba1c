I"(<p>The contemporary era is characterised by an increase in inequality throughout the world. This is best exemplified by the divergence of the performance of the stock market from the general fortunes of the everyday person. As with any political and economic issue the cause is complex and involves a number of interrelated factors: The rise of globalisation, the fall of the labour union, the neoliberal consensus, the growth of financialisation and other factors all play a role in bringing about the current situation, and none occurs independently of any other. In this essay I will define the rise of the stock market and the fall of the economy, examine these contributing factors and describe how the rise of neoliberalism has led to the divergence of the stock market and the economy as a whole.</p>
